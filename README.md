## Day-59---Working-with-large-datasets-using-Dask
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers working with large datasets using Dask

Working with large datasets using Dask in Python involves leveraging its parallel computing capabilities to handle datasets that are too large to fit into memory or require substantial computational resources. Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that scales from a single machine to a distributed cluster, allowing users to process large datasets efficiently.

### **Key Features of Dask**

**Parallel Processing:** Dask splits large datasets into smaller chunks and processes them in parallel, improving performance.

**Out-of-Core Computing:** Dask handles datasets that exceed RAM capacity by streaming data from disk in manageable chunks.

**Scalability:** Dask can scale computations from a single machine to distributed clusters with minimal code changes.

**Familiar APIs:** Dask provides familiar APIs like Dask DataFrame (similar to Pandas), Dask Array (similar to NumPy), and Dask Bag (similar to Python iterables).
